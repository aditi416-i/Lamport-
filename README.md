# Lamport-
Lamport Algorithm, is a logical clock algorithm that determines the order of events, It assigns a timestamp to each event in the system, including message transmissions and process executions, which can be used to determine the order of events.
When a process wants to enter a critical section, it sends a request message to all other processes and increments its logical clock. When a process receives a request message, it compares the timestamp of the message to its own logical clock. If the message is older than the process's own timestamp, it sends an acknowledgment message back to the requesting process. Otherwise, the process defers its response until its own logical clock has caught up with the timestamp of the request message.
Once a process receives acknowledgments from all other processes, it enters the critical section and performs its task. When it's finished, it sends a release message to all other processes and increments its logical clock.
If another process is waiting to enter the critical section, it will receive the release message and update its own logical clock accordingly. The process with the highest timestamp can then enter the critical section and perform its task.
